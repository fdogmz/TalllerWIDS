Joy Baby Ladybug Costume Handmade Crochet Knit Photo Prop;Supper cute. I bought it for my newborn Son to take photo shots. The quality is good. I love it.;5;1
Bugaboo Comfort Transport Bag, Black;"I recently purchased this bag for an upcoming plane trip. The bag itself is a lot bigger than I had anticipated, so I would definitely take out the measuring tape so you know what you are expecting size wise - both folded up and with the stroller inside. All folded up, it looks like it's about the size of a nice roller garment bag. It is definitely bigger than your average carry-on suitcase (not that you'd take this thing carry on, but just as a frame of reference re size.) I've got the bee and the graco adapter; both fit inside it, which is fantastic. You strap the stroller to the inside of the bag before you zip it all up and it seems very secure. It comes with a bag with a handle, which I think is really only useful if you have donkey, as you need to take the wheels off and put it into the bag. I put my rain cover in that extra bag and it fits perfectly in there. So when I travel, I think I will put the rain cover inside the extra bag, along with the stroller and graco adapter. The real test is when I actually use it. I decided to get this one vs the compact travel bag, as it seems like the stroller will be more protected. I think that was the right decision. It looks like all the bugaboo strollers can fit into this bag, so that is nice. It also comes with a nice shoulder strap. When the stroller is inside and everything is all zipped up, it wheels around very nicely, and the handling is smooth. The fabric. clips and straps all seem durable too, and the fabric seems like it's easy to clean. When it will be time to pack it up, when i'm at the gate, it may look a tad ridiculous because it is quite an operation to get it all in, but it's manageable. If you are traveling by yourself with the baby, I think it will be hard to manage ie holding the baby and packing it up. So I would recommend having someone hold the baby (like a nice airline gate attendant) while you're trying to wrangle with it. All in all, I am happy with my purchase. But again, the true test will happen we go on our trip. I am giving this 4 stars vs 5 just because the bag is a lot bigger even folded up than I had expected.UPDATE: We are now back from our trip and I can confirm that everything I wrote on the review holds true. I am keeping the four stars. The main goal was to keep our nice bee stroller protected during airplane travel and it definitely was. It had a few dust etc marks on the outside when we retrieved it, so I know it was definitely protecting the stroller. I even saw some strollers being loaded up into the belly of the plane before boarding and saw the handlers chucking them onto the plane. I felt bad about the strollers that were not wrapped up in any way and relieved to know ours was tucked away safely. Also, the graco attachment and the bag with the rain gear fit in perfectly. I even had room to fit in my raincoat which I did not need during the flight. The reason why it's not 5 stars? The size. When folded up and not in use, it's a bit awkward. And if you don't fold up exactly right, the shoulder strap can be off and the whole thing is wonky and annoying, especially if you are trying to walk with it. Also, lugging the thing through security to the gate is kind of awkward and a pain. And when it's time to put the stroller into the actual thing, it's kind of an ordeal. You take up soooo much room, because all laid out the thing is HUGE, it has a big footprint. But by the last leg of our trip, I became a pro and was pretty fast in zipping it all up. All of the airline staff watched in amazement as I unwrapped this huge thing and then put in our stroller. But at the end of the day, it did its primary job and protected our stroller. I am happy with the purchase and I am sure we will use this again when we travel.";4;1
Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate;Very soft for my infants crib and helps keep her warm in the winter months the color is more of a very very light pink;5;1
Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink;Love this bib for my toddler. It does seem to stain easily but I don't really care because it is so easy for me to wash it. It doesn't seem to stink like other bibs start to do over time. My son is 2 and could wear it for quite some time still.;5;1
Skip Hop Duo Double - Canvas-Charcoal;I ordered this bag because of the many compartments it had.  The only thing is, I had to exchange it for the smaller one because it was a little too spacious.  I imagine it would be better suited for someone expecting twins or someone with more than one child.  I am extremely happy with the smaller version although it doesn't have the exact same appearance.  Still, Skip Hop did a great job at making these bags convenient and visually appealing!;4;1
Wee Gallery Wall Graphics, Jungle;I like that it's an artful look that is not a traditional theme.  The trees and deer is cool.  But some other animals are not cut out well where they have extra stickere paper around them where it would look better without it.  I would still buy it know this.;4;1
NUK Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, 0+ Months, Colors May Vary;I am putting 5 stars for this item because I know these are good pacifiers but the fact is, what I am commenting on is the color that was sent to us via. Amazon.I added this pacifier to my registry knowing this is the kind that I love, however the photo is a blue pacifier which I would say is easily for a boy or girl.  My husband ordered one pacifier as a cute little gift for me and when it came it was pink! We are not finding out what we are having... I love pink but what if we have a boy??? I don't recommend ordering this through Amazon unless you don't care what color you get.  We shall see if the pink pacifier is accurate or not.  I just think if they are sending any old color they should send a neutral one at least.;5;1
Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red;I bought this hoping to be able to still carry my infant and get some things done around the house. It works great and she loves it. I love way it feels and it's very simple to use.;5;1
Sassy 2 Count Grow Up Cup, Purple/Orange, 9 Ounce;"My two year old can drink out of regular cups, but loves to pour out her drink. The grow up cup is spill proof; it cuts down on 99% of mess. This is a great cup for toddlers on the go. It's not a ""baby"" cup, so my daughter feels like a big kid.";5;1
"Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy";My three month old daughter loves this toy!  We don't leave the house without it!  She loves the colors and different textures, and she's just recently starting chewing on the rings and antlers.  I'd highly recommend this toy for anyone with an infant!;5;1
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker;Better than the baby bullet - if for no other reason than it has a steamer which perfectly cooks annoying vegetables like peas.;5;1
Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White;I really like this crib so far.  Hopefully baby likes it as much when she tests it out in a few months.  The piece arrived without any packaging issues and set up was easy (my husband and his two friends did it for me).  I didn't have any smelling issues past the first day or so after airing out the room.  The expresso color was a bit darker than what I was expecting, but I liked it better that way actually, so no complaints there!;5;1
Celebration Candles 1-21 Year Numbered Birthday Candle, Pink;We ordered two candles for two couples who had had babies within 10 days of each other -- one boy and one girl.  The candles seemed to be a hit -- sure beat Christmas ornaments...;4;1
Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black;The Britax sun shades work perfect. Needed something extra on our tinted windows for those long trips with the grandkids. These fit perfect in the rear passenger windows of our Tacoma (4dr) and provided extra shading from the sun. Covers about 90% of the window and is easy to install, even for the grandkids. Yes, like the reviews that I read, you must remove the sun shades to open the windows. For us on long road trips it wasn't an issue. Easily cleaned using a microfiber towel. The feature that I like is that the screens fold into a small plastic pouch, the original packaging, and can easily be stored behind the back seat(s) of our truck. Great product.;5;1
JJ Cole Original Toddler Bundleme, Graphite, Toddler;This is great- Use it in place of a blanket or heavy pants. This keeps your toddler nice and warm on a cold day.;5;1
Thirsties 3 Pack Boys Fab Doublers Soft Cotton Velour, Ocean Blue/Meadow/White, Large;These are super soft, and awesome inserts for cloth diapers. But they can be irritating for sensitive skin babes.. beware!;4;1
Carters Animal Frame, Pink Elephant;Cute picture frame. I used it as part of the decoration at a baby shower and it was well received.;4;1
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing;"This is a beautiful swing; everyone that comes in our home comments on it. It also works very well (we have had it for about a month and have had no problems), is extremely well constructed, and is easy to maneuver. It was somewhat difficult for my husband to put together, but he's not very mechanically inclined. I'm sure it's no difficult to put together than any other swing. The a/c adapter to plug the swing in is a tremendous bonus. We had a similar but battery-operated swing for our first child, which she LOVED, but it KILLED us on batteries. They just didn't last long, and were so expensive to keep replacing. I LOVE that we can just plug this one in. And, it has the option to use batteries if you don't want to or can't plug it in. I also like the options to switch back & forth from cradle or traditional swing motion, as well as to remove the swing/cradle portion and place it on the floor as a stationary seat. Very convenient. And, I like the built-in blanket-cover; no need to put a blanket on the baby! Oh, and the cover is easily removable and machine washable. Added bonuses. The music/ sound effects are pleasant and tranquil (not annoying, like some!), and there are plenty of volume and swing speed options.The only thing I don't love about this swing is the mobile. It's cute, but not very stimulating for baby. It does't move on its one, and the colors are drab. Also, the little Asian-inspired cones that hang over the animal figures hide their shape, so you can't even really see what they are. Not the greatest design. Other than that, this swing is fantastic. I would definitely recommend buying it.";4;1
Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego;We bought this stroller last year when going to Disney World and it was a great purchase. It is lightweight, collapses well and is comfortable. One of the key differentiators between this stroller and others is that this one reclines fully so if your little one falls asleep it is easy to let them rest in it. The shade canopy could be larger but overall I was very pleased with this stroller.;5;1
Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby;It's very easy to push and has a ton of storage. The kids love being able to face each other. and I love that they can entertain each other while I'm shopping!;5;1
The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty System;This potty leaks all over - it is awful.  Everytime my son uses the potty it leaks all over the floor - save your money and buy a single one piece potty.;1;0
"Baby Jogger Black Parent Console for Mini Single &amp; Double Strollers";This is overpriced in my opinion- velcro is loud and only one drink holder- the sunshine kids one is less than half the price and is one large open space with opitions fo two or more drinks, or you can push them to the side if you need to put in larger items.;2;0
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate;"Nearly every one we had must have been defective. The frames bent easily and stayed bent (and yes, I know the sides are supposed to bend and then snap into position but it was more than that...they stayed bent).Also, if you put this up, plan on keeping it up. I would describe this more as a permanent solution rather than an ""easy to remove and put up"" travel gate. From the reviews here, it is clear that some people love this but it just didn't work for our lifestyle.Pre-tested before baby came as well as with a friend's baby. Totally frustrating and we followed the directions perfectly. As others have noted, the directions are not easy to follow and you have to practice to understand how to get this to work. Even so, after extending the top and bottom sides, placing the gate on the floor (a required step according to manufacturer instructions) and then locking it in place, we were extremely...well, grumpy. Further practice didn't make things any better. I would never use this as a portable baby gate!Uh-uh. Looking for something simpler. I would avoid using this after going through so many steps each time! Again, for a permanent or long-term gate (for crawlers to first walkers), this might work...as a travel gate, nope...not from what I experienced.";2;0
Tadpoles 21 Sq Ft Puzzle Pieces Playmat Set, Pink/Brown;"This playmat DOES NOT COVER 21 sq ft. It was such a ripoff; it barely covers 16 sq ft. I needed to cover a larger area and was very angry when I set it down, but could not return it because I opened it. Very unhappy.";1;0
Carseat Canopy - The Whole Caboodle 5PC set - Baby Infant Car Seat Cover with complete matching set of accessories (Knott);The package only contained the Car Seat Canopy outer but non of the other parts that are promised in this page. Very disappointing experience.;1;0
Hoppop Toro Potty, Lime;I like the idea of this potty because it's small and simple.  However, it can be difficult for kids to use because if they don't sit on it exactly the right way, it's uncomfortable.  The pieces also come apart too easily so I get frustrated with having to fix it often, and my daughter has been pinched twice.  A potty that can hurt isn't a good idea.  I wonder if the donut from Hoppop might work better, but I got this one since it looked taller.;2;0
Star Wars Bed;I had the same problem with my credit card and gift card being charged with the same purchase.Amazon insisted that is not what happened, but I have my credit card receipt and the balance on my gift card is lower by the same amount.Whats up with that?And I too spoke with someone that had an accent that I could barely understand.;1;0
Inglesina 2012 Zuma White Highchair, Light Blue;I really have never written a scathing review before and I really wanted to like the 2012 Inglesina Zuma White Highchair, but my wife has really let me know on a daily basis how unhappy she is with it.  We have twins, so we purchased two of them!  The price was pretty good, and the quality seemed like it was constructed well. We really were taken in by the looks and style and it matched our kitchen. The engineering is just dreadful.1. The maneuverability is difficult because it's an awkward design with the extended legs. You just can move it quickly or easily.2. Setting it up and storing it takes several steps and one of them sometimes requires repeating over an over because of an internal latch mechanism that doesn't always release. It's a real pain.3. Cleaning the seats is a chore because you have to remove the straps and speaking of straps...4. Straps are a magnet to babies and these are very long and floppy. We had to use Velcro straps to keep the kids from sucking on them. Also, it would be nice to have a padded shoulder strap so it would prevent the strap from sometimes cutting into the child's neck.5. Cracks everywhere!! The top tray and sides are designed in such a way that food will get into every nook and cranny. This drives my wife nuts!We could never recommend this highchair to anyone because it costs too much money to have all of these issues.This is only our opinion and you may not care about any of these things. It's a really cool looking highchair!;2;0
2 Tubing for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - 100% BPA Free, and Medela Compatible. Replacement Parts for Medela Tubing Part # 87212, 8007212;does not it .. to my pump wrong choice...and cheap quality.........my pumps knob broke while fixing it on the pump;2;0
Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White;I really wanted to like this, I even ignored the other reviews hoping that they were wrong. I really wish I hadn't - I was so disappointed! I tried to set it up and couldn't even get past the startup on my phone. The monitor wasn't recognized by my iPhone or my husband's iPad or droid phone. We tried several times before we eventually gave up. I can't have a baby monitor that is SO unreliable (especially one that I spent $300 on). Save yourself the time and aggravation and find another baby monitor.;1;0
"VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units";It was fine for almost a year, but suddenly you can't read the screen - it just looks like a jumble.;1;0
Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby;This whale is cute but it just sort of balances on the faucet. You can't get a tight fit even with the adjustable fins, so even a gentle touch from curious hands makes it fall off. Defeats the purpose entirely.;1;0
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System;Inconsistency in temperature. Too bulky to bring out.. the handles comes off when carried.  I've used this everyday for the past 7 months.. Wish I got something smaller, so I can carry outside and use.;2;0
"Safety 1st Cling Sunshade 21&quot; wide - 2 Pack";If you want to buy a piece of plastic.. this one will work. It looks horrible, on mine it looks like someone used scissors to cut it out as it is not straight. It will block the sun and for the price it works ok. It is a little more difficult to get to stay up without bubbles compared to similar products... It just looks really bad.;1;0
Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor;"We thought we were paying for a good monitor, but have had problems with regular static, clicking at odd times, and a loud continual noise when the phone rings or when you place a call. Other than that, you can hear every movement and breath the baby takes. I have read reviews on other brands found customers who bought less expensive monitors that work without these problems. As a mother who is trying to get some sleep while keep an ear out for your child the last thing I want to do is battle the monitor to find the &quot;right&quot; position for it to function properly.I am trading ours in.";2;0
Go Mama Go Designs Snug and Tug Swaddling Blanket, Large, Green;The way this product is designed makes it very difficult to swaddle a squirmy baby. Even Go Mama Go Designs' own product demo video on their website shows the spokeswoman having trouble with it. To use it you have to:1) Open a pouch and place the baby inside up to his/her neck.2) Get the pouch closed while keeping baby's arms inside of it (no small task!).3) Thread one wing around the pouch and through a slit in the swaddler. Still while keeping baby's arms inside the darn thing.4) Wrap the threaded wing beneath the baby and fasten the velcro on baby's back. While baby fights to free his/her arms.5) Wrap the other wing all the way around the baby and fasten the velcro on baby's front.And that's if you can even line up the velcro where it belongs. I picked this up because the product features said it fit babies from 14-28 pounds (though when I received the product, it claims to work only for 14-22 pound babies). My baby was 16 pounds 10 ounces at the time, so it should have fit well. But it's way too large to get a good, tight swaddle. Once I get it tight enough to keep my baby swaddled properly, the velcro tabs are pulled far beyond the areas where their closures reside. So the second baby moves even the slightest bit, the wings come loose because there's nothing to fasten them to. I'm hoping it will work better for us once my baby is larger.The one use I do have for this product now is on cold nights. I use this over a Summer Infant SwaddleMeSummer Infant Swaddleme Microfleece, Blue, Largeto help keep my baby warm. And since the pouch on the Snug and Tug goes up to his neck, he can't get his hands completely out like he can with the SwaddleMe alone (that product opens at the waist, letting roaming hands free easily).;2;0
